# Inference

This document describes how to run a checkpoint: install, get a checkpoint, ask it questions
from the command line, and serve it over HTTP. Strands decider answers typed questions about a
state, the text to classify; it does not generate text. A question is a `noul` (yes or no,
returned as P(true)), a `choice` (one of N options) or a `score` (a level on an ordered
scale). Install the package, point the commands at the published Hub id or at a checkpoint you
trained, then `strands-decider ask` or `strands-decider serve`. Pass `--device cuda`, `mps`, `cpu` or `mlx`
explicitly; without it the CLI picks cuda, then mps, then cpu, and mlx only when asked for. A
checkpoint from `training/recipe.sh all` is already calibrated; calibrate any other
checkpoint with `strands-decider calibrate` before you serve it.

## Environments for serving

On Linux, or under WSL2 on Windows, with an NVIDIA GPU, serving uses the training
environment in [Setup](../training/README.md#setup).

A server started inside WSL (`strands-decider serve ... --port 8099`) is reachable from Windows
at `127.0.0.1:8099` for as long as its WSL session is alive.

Each device has an install extra, so a deployment names its device the same way everywhere. The
extras ship with the next release (0.1.0 on PyPI has only `train` and `dev`); until then, install
from a clone, for example `pip install -e ".[mlx]"`.

| `--device` | Install | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `cuda` | `pip install "strands-decider[cuda]"` | flash-linear-attention (Linux). causal-conv1d compiles against the local CUDA toolkit and is installed separately: `pip install causal-conv1d --no-build-isolation`. |
| `mps` | `pip install "strands-decider[mps]"` | Nothing: the base install. |
| `cpu` | `pip install "strands-decider[cpu]"` | Nothing: the base install. |
| `mlx` | `pip install "strands-decider[mlx]"` | mlx and mlx-lm (Apple silicon only). |

flash-linear-attention installs on a Mac without Triton, but its kernels need Triton, so it
cannot run there. `mps_kernels.py` therefore steps aside only when Triton is present too, and
the `cuda` extra is marked Linux-only.

**Serving on macOS (Apple silicon), inference only.** No `flash-linear-attention`:
Triton has no macOS build. Nothing else changes; pass `--device mps`.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install torch==2.7.1 transformers==5.17.0 peft==0.21.0
pip install -e ".[dev]"
strands-decider serve checkpoints/hobson-2b-recipe --device mps --port 8099
```

Transformers' `causal_conv1d_fn` falls back to its reference PyTorch path. On CPU,
`chunk_gated_delta_rule` also falls back. On MPS, `mps_kernels.py` replaces that second
function, so only the first fallback matters there, and it costs 32 ms a forward.

**macOS (Apple silicon) with MLX.** The `mlx` extra adds mlx and mlx-lm, and `--device mlx`
runs the torso on Metal through mlx-lm ([Serving on a Mac with MLX](#serving-on-a-mac-with-mlx)).
MLX is opt-in: with the extra installed, a command without `--device` still runs on MPS.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,mlx]"
strands-decider serve checkpoints/hobson-2b-recipe --device mlx --port 8099
```

**CPU only.** The same commands as on macOS, with `--device cpu`. On Linux without a GPU,
`pip install torch==2.7.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` skips the CUDA
wheels. Both reference fallback paths above apply, and inference is much slower than on a
GPU.

## Model artifact

The v19 reference weights are published as
[`StrandsAgents/strands-decider-2B-hobson-v19`](https://huggingface.co/StrandsAgents/strands-decider-2B-hobson-v19).
Every command that takes a checkpoint path also takes that id, and the loader downloads the
repository to the Hub cache. You can equally train your own with the recipe
([training/README.md](../training/README.md#usage)); `recipe.sh` writes it to
`checkpoints/hobson-2b-recipe`.

A checkpoint directory holds these files. `StrandsDeciderModel.save_pretrained` in `modeling.py`
writes them, `strands-decider calibrate` adds the temperatures, and `StrandsDeciderModel.load` reads them.

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `strands_decider_config.json` | The model configuration: the base model name, the readout type and size, the window (`max_length`) and the fitted temperatures. A checkpoint saved before the rename, such as the published v19, holds `hobson_config.json` instead; `load` reads either |
| `lora/` | The LoRA adapter (`adapter_config.json`, `adapter_model.safetensors`) |
| `slot_head.pt` or `head.safetensors` | The readout weights. `save_pretrained` writes `slot_head.pt`. An export from `strands_decider.hf_export` holds `head.safetensors` instead. |
| `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer_config.json` | The tokenizer |
| `chat_template.jinja` | The chat template, saved with the tokenizer. Inference does not read it. |

Training also writes `train_config.json` and `history.json`. Inference does not read them.

The base weights are not in the checkpoint. At first use, `load` downloads
`Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B-Base` (about 4.5 GB) from Hugging Face, at the revision in the config's
`base_revision`. A checkpoint without one uses the `base_model_revision` that its
`provenance.json` records for the same base model, so a Hugging Face export loads the base it
was trained on. With neither, the loader gets the current `main` of that repository.

`python -m strands_decider.hf_export export CKPT OUT --run-id RUN` writes a checkpoint as a Hugging
Face-format folder. Without `--run-id`, the exporter takes the run id from a
`results/<run-id>/` part of the CKPT path, and it stops if the path has none. The folder
holds the readout as `head.safetensors`, so it has no pickle files. It also holds the PEFT
adapter, the tokenizer and configuration files, and a model card (`README.md`).
`provenance.json`, `LICENSE.md` with the licence status and `MANIFEST.sha256` complete it.
`python -m strands_decider.hf_export verify DIR` checks a folder. `StrandsDeciderModel.load` reads the
folder as it reads a checkpoint, and the base weights still download separately from
Hugging Face. Where a command takes a checkpoint path (`strands-decider serve`, `strands-decider ask`,
`strands-decider info`), a Hub model repo id such as `StrandsAgents/strands-decider-2B-hobson-v19` also works: the loader
downloads the repo to the Hub cache. `strands-decider calibrate` writes into the checkpoint, so it
needs a local directory. OUT can be a local directory or an `s3://` URI. The exporter does not upload to
the Hugging Face Hub.

## Ask

There are three question types, and all three are one mechanism read back three ways.

- A **noul** question is a yes/no question. It has two options and returns the
  probability of "true".
- A **choice** question has any number of options. It returns the top option, a
  probability for each option, and a confidence: the top probability, rescaled so that an
  even split gives 0 and a certain answer gives 1, whatever the number of options.
- A **score** question has ordered levels. It returns an expected value on that scale,
  the distribution, and a confidence.

On the command line, a choice or a score is written as `question=option,option,...`. The
confidence is computed from the distribution, not predicted.

The output below was recorded from a v19 checkpoint, which the v19 reference recipe
trains. The command below names `checkpoints/hobson-2b-recipe`, the path
`training/recipe.sh` (or `bash training/recipe.sh`) writes; pass
`StrandsAgents/strands-decider-2B-hobson-v19` instead to run the published weights. On a Mac,
add `--device mps`. A retrained checkpoint gives somewhat different numbers with the same
answers: a later v19 retrain gives 0.809, `technical` at 0.783 and a score confidence
of 0.472 on CPU.

```bash
strands-decider ask checkpoints/hobson-2b-recipe \
  --state "Help! My payouts have been failing for 3 days." \
  --noul "Does this convey urgency?" \
  --choice "Which team should handle this?=billing,technical,sales" \
  --score "How frustrated is the writer?=calm,frustrated,very angry"
```

```
noul_0 noul = 0.801
choice_0 -> technical (confidence 0.622)
    technical                0.748
    billing                  0.234
    sales                    0.018
score_0 score = 1.24 (confidence 0.578)
    0: calm                                     0.093
    1: frustrated                               0.578
    2: very angry                               0.330
```

That is real output from v19, not an illustration — and it is
worth reading the confidence, not just the answer. Whether failing payouts are
`billing` or `technical` is arguable, and the model leans but says so: 0.622 is in the
"confirm" band of the [routing convention](../docs/architecture.md#the-routing-convention), well short
of the 0.9 at which that convention acts without a check.

## Serve

```bash
strands-decider serve checkpoints/hobson-2b-recipe --port 8000
```

`POST /v1/systemone` takes a state and typed questions. JevBench's `typesafe` adapter
targets this endpoint and runs against it unmodified: 231 of 231 tasks attempted and
schema validity 1.000 ([External benchmark](../evaluation/jevbench.md#external-benchmark-jevbench-v1-public-set)).
Compatibility with the Jev API itself is not verified. `GET /health` returns the model
name, the checkpoint path, the base model, the device and the calibration temperature.

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and has no authentication. Its behaviour under
concurrent requests is not verified. Use it for local experiments only
([Security](../README.md#security)).

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "state": "Help! My payouts have been failing for 3 days.",
  "model": "hobson-latest",
  "questions": {
    "is_urgent":  {"type": "noul",   "instructions": "Does this convey urgency?"},
    "department": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Route it.",
                   "criteria": {"billing": "money", "technical": "bugs", "sales": "pricing"}},
    "frustration":{"type": "score",  "instructions": "How frustrated?",
                   "criteria": ["Calm", "Frustrated", "Very angry"]}
  }
}'
```

A hybrid torso such as v14's shares the state across questions like any other; a single
question is encoded in one pass ([Asking many questions is nearly free](#asking-many-questions-is-nearly-free)).

The `state` may be empty when the question carries the whole task. An option description
may be a string, structured data (rendered as JSON, like a structured `state`), or `null`
for a bare label.

By default a prompt longer than the checkpoint's window is shortened to fit: the state is
cut, and the question keeps its options. `--strict-window` refuses such a prompt instead,
with HTTP 422 and a message that names the context window, for an evaluation that forbids
truncation. `--max-batch N` (default 32) sets how many questions one forward pass encodes;
lower it when a very long state with many questions does not fit in GPU memory.

## Asking many questions is nearly free

*The latency table below was measured on v7, a Qwen3 torso. The cache now also forks the
recurrent state of the hybrid Qwen3.5 torso
([Hybrid torsos share the prefix too](../docs/architecture.md#design-decisions-worth-knowing)).
The v14 figures at the end of this section use it.*

The state is encoded **once** and its KV cache is broadcast across the question batch;
only the short question suffixes are forwarded per question.

```
naive:  N x (state + question)     tokens
strands-decider: state + N x question       tokens
```

Measured against the served 1.7B checkpoint, one ~640-token state:

| questions | latency | input tokens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 219.4 ms | 666 |
| 6 | 217.4 ms | 966 |

Five extra questions cost roughly nothing. The naive path would have encoded ~4,000
tokens instead of 966. The questions genuinely evaluate independently — no question
can see another's text — which is what keeps the answers decomposable.

`--no-prefix-cache` falls back to plain batched encoding. The two paths are
*numerically identical in fp32* (pinned by `test_prefix_cache_is_exact_in_fp32`, and for
hybrid torsos by `tests/test_prefix_cache.py`); in bf16 they differ by ~2e-3 from
accumulation order alone, far below any threshold worth routing on. On v14 on the RTX 3090, eight
questions over a ~2,000-token state take 369 ms through the shared prefix against
1,964 ms batched, and sixteen take 445 ms against 4,086 ms. A request with one question
skips the prefix path: it would pay a second forward for nothing.

## Serving on a Mac

Measured with v19 on an M3 Pro (36 GB) running macOS 26.6: torch 2.7.1, transformers
5.17.0, bf16 on MPS.
**The answers match the RTX 3090 run, but the latency does not.** Under 300 tokens, a v19
question takes a median 153 ms warm and 310 ms on the first request of its length. Across
JevBench the warm median is 234 ms and the 95th percentile is 2,628 ms. These figures are
for v19 on this Mac only. They are not a latency claim for other hardware or other
checkpoints.

The accuracy and latency measurements are in
[Serving on a Mac: accuracy and latency](../evaluation/results.md#serving-on-a-mac-accuracy-and-latency).

**One kernel had to be replaced.** Without `fla`, the reference chunk rule for the 18
Gated DeltaNet layers was 806 of 1,739 ms of a 1,024-token forward. Nearly all of it
was `torch.linalg.solve_triangular`, about 20 ms a call on MPS. `mps_kernels.py` inverts
the same unit-lower-triangular system by recursive block inversion, which is six levels
of batched matmuls, and applies the inverse to both right-hand sides. The engine
installs it for MPS only, and the forward is 1.7x faster (1,024 tokens: 1,750 to
1,029 ms). The obvious inverse, the finite Neumann product (I-N)(I+N²)(I+N⁴)..., passed
random-input tests and was wrong by up to 5e8 on real activations. Correlated,
l2-normalised keys make the powers of N huge before they cancel.
`tests/test_mps_kernels.py` builds its inputs that way and fails 14 cases against that
version.

## Serving on a Mac with MLX

`--device mlx` runs the torso on Apple silicon's GPU through mlx-lm
([`mlx_engine.py`](../src/strands_decider/mlx_engine.py)). mlx-lm implements Qwen3.5 with fused
Metal kernels, Gated DeltaNet included, where MPS dispatches every op separately and has none
of the CUDA kernels. Nothing else moves: `MLXEngine` subclasses `SystemOneEngine`, so prompt
rendering, tokenisation, truncation, option positions, both evaluation paths, the
temperatures and the fp32 head are the torch engine's own code. The head runs on the CPU, as
torch.

Measured with v19 on an M4 Pro, one question takes 113 ms at 222 input tokens, 486 ms at 1,118
and 1,764 ms at 4,094, against 162, 682 and 2,685 ms on MPS. Sixteen questions on a 1,024-token
state take 1,060 ms against 1,622 ms. The answers are the same: on 54 answers compared with v19
in fp32 on the CPU, none changes on either device, and the largest probability difference is
0.0138 on MLX and 0.0051 on MPS. Most of MLX's difference comes from merging the LoRA adapter
into the bf16 weights at load, where torch keeps it unmerged; with the torso in fp32 it is
0.0036. On a tiny random Qwen3.5, `tests/test_mlx_engine.py` finds the torch engine's answers to
four decimal places, on Metal and on MLX's CPU backend. The measurements, and the commands that reproduce them, are in
[Serving on a Mac through MLX: accuracy and latency](../evaluation/results.md#serving-on-a-mac-through-mlx-accuracy-and-latency).

Limits. mlx-lm is pinned to the minor version tested, because the engine uses its Qwen3.5
module layout and prompt-cache classes. The adapter merge refuses DoRA, `modules_to_save`,
trainable token embeddings, per-module ranks and quantised base weights. `--dtype` in
`bench_local.py` applies to torch devices only. The engine caps MLX's buffer cache at 1 GiB
(`mlx_engine.DEFAULT_CACHE_LIMIT`); MLX's own default is its memory limit, nearly all of RAM.
Evaluations run one at a time, because `_fit` keeps a request's option offsets on the engine for
`_option_idx` to read; the torch engine has the same race (#9).
